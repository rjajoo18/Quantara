## 🌍 Inspiration

Over the past year, escalating tariff announcements have triggered immediate and often severe volatility across global equity markets. Traditional financial models assume smooth price evolution, while geopolitical policy moves create sudden structural shocks. Prediction markets often reflect sentiment shifts *before* institutions fully price them in — yet no existing tool quantifies how tariff data affects market trends across countries and sectors.

**Our core question:** What if we could quantify tariff uncertainty *before* it hits and simulate its ripple effects across global markets in real time?

Quantara was built to transform policy uncertainty into measurable, forward-looking financial insight.

## 🚀 What It Does

Quantara is a full-stack predictive analytics platform that stress-tests global markets against shifting tariff landscapes. By bridging prediction market sentiment with stochastic financial modeling, it provides a real-time macroeconomic impact simulator.

**Key capabilities:**
- Calculates a **"Surprise Gap"** between market expectations and tariff probability
- Visualizes geopolitical risk via an **interactive global choropleth map**
- Simulates **90-day price trajectories** for major indices and sectors
- Models discontinuous policy shocks using **jump-diffusion mathematics**
- Translates complex quantitative outputs into plain-English via an **AI analyst**

Instead of reacting after the market moves, Quantara enables proactive macro risk assessment.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Quantara operates through a dual-engine architecture supported by an intelligence layer.

### 1. 🧮 Probability Engine — ML-Driven Tariff Prediction

The core of Quantara's probability estimation is a **stacked ensemble model** that combines **CatBoost** and **Logistic Regression** to predict the likelihood of a tariff event occurring for a given country or sector.

**Model Architecture:**
- **CatBoost** serves as the primary learner, handling nonlinear feature interactions and categorical geopolitical variables without requiring extensive preprocessing.
- **Logistic Regression** acts as a calibrated second-stage model, taking CatBoost's output probabilities alongside raw features to produce a well-calibrated final tariff probability.
- The stacked output is then **combined with Kalshi prediction market data** to compute the **Surprise Gap** — the delta between what our model predicts and what the market has already priced in.

**Training Datasets:**

| Dataset | Source | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Historical tariff & trade policy data | Our World in Data / public datasets | Ground truth labels and policy history |
| Macroeconomic indicators | World Bank / public sources | Features: GDP, trade balance, current account deficits |
| News & sentiment data | NewsAPI / web scraping | Sentiment signals preceding tariff announcements |

**Feature Engineering highlights:**
- Country-level trade deficit and surplus ratios
- Rolling news sentiment scores leading up to policy events
- Historical tariff frequency and escalation patterns
- Macroeconomic stress indicators (e.g. trade-to-GDP ratio)

The ensemble probability output is combined with Kalshi market-implied probabilities to produce the **Surprise Gap** — a forward-looking policy stress indicator surfaced through an interactive global choropleth map that lets users instantly identify geopolitical hotspots.

### 2. 📊 Impact Engine — Stochastic Forecasting
We convert the Surprise Gap into projected financial impact using a **Merton Jump-Diffusion model**. Unlike traditional geometric Brownian motion models, this framework captures:

- **Jump Component:** The instantaneous market shock following a tariff announcement
- **Diffusion Component:** The longer-term cost absorption and repricing process

We run **Monte Carlo simulations** to generate 90-day probabilistic trajectories for:
- Major indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow)
- Sector-specific exposure
- Country-sensitive industries (e.g., automotive, semiconductors)

### 3. 🤖 Intelligence Layer — RAG Chatbot
A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** powered by **Snowflake Cortex** interprets complex outputs in plain English. The AI analyst:
- Interprets jagged simulation graphs
- Correlates projections with policy documents
- Connects outcomes to supply chain metadata
- Explains sector-specific valuation cliffs clearly
